# TODO: Debug and Fix Tailwind CSS Not Working

- [ ] Fix the PostCSS config to use the correct `tailwindcss` plugin instead of `@tailwindcss/postcss`.
- [ ] Remove `@tailwindcss/postcss` from `devDependencies` if not needed.
- [ ] Double-check that Tailwind is being built by running the dev server and inspecting the output.
- [ ] If still not working, check for any build errors or console warnings.
